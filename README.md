# minecraft-loot-table
Custom Minecraft loot tables to make the game easier but not too much easier. Mainly for playing with younger kids.

## Install
- Create a new world in Minecraft then save and exit.
- `cd _Minecraft Install Dir_/saves/_Save Name_/datapacks`
- `git clone https://github.com/BrantOlsen/minecraft-loot-table CustomLootTable`
- Open your world back up again. 

If you do not want open and close your world, you can do `/reload` in the world to reload loot tables, but cheats must be enabled for that.
